# NAME

inkgrad - Make gradients between 2 files unique

# SYNOPSIS

`inkgrad [-h] INSVGFILE INSVGFILE OUTSVGFILE`

# OPTIONS

`-h, --help`
:   Show help message and exit.

# USAGE

In some circumstances I don't really understand, the Inkscape bug still
tampers with the gradient and you may want to make a group of the object
you're importing to be on the safe side.
